    "Some bias could sneak into the app's recommendations / performance evaluation by not taking into account users who have physical problems that lower their ability to excercise. The app could take user input that asks them to enter any health problems they may have and shape their fitness goals around those problems. Another few inputs the app could take would be age and weight, which should also allow the app to change the difficulty level of a fitness plan. "

    "2. Spotify has very similar and generalized recommendations in a playlist that may have more diverse music or very specific genres which makes it difficult for people to enjoy music more than the couple of songs that they already know. This is a large problem because people's music choices change often and also people may get bored of the same songs, and if so, they would need a source to get more good songs for them.\n",
    "3. This bias might be being caused by a lack of developing the AI that recommends songs because it can only recommend a similar genre rather than the same type of sound. This is interesting, however, because in Spotify Wrapped it seems to pinpoint the exact type of music that you have listened to, which the recommendations don't seem to mirror.\n",
    "4. One solution would be to develop the AI further and allow it to find differences between more specific types of songs so that the user enjoys their recommendations more, but also for spotify to provide playlists that allow the user to discover new and different music"
