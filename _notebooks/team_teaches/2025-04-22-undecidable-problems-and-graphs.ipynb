    "In some pages, they will detect some infinite loops written and/or monitor the runtime of a loop and break out of it if it runs for too long. Another page, Repl.it uses a method that doesn't break out of the loop or prevent it, but instead uses other techniques to prevent the browser from overflowing with data, but this can cause problems with blocking keyboard or mouse input. Codepen, an online compiler, monitors loops that continue running after 2 seconds and break out of it after 2.2 seconds. These values can also be changed."
