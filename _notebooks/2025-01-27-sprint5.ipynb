    "- The Purpose of my overall group's program is for people to have a designated place to explore and review books as well as post their favorite books for people to find. We accomplish this through a variety of pages such as the Moderator's Picks page and the pages inside of it, like the Book Gallery.\n",

    "- My individual features involve the preferences page as well as the usersDb database. The preferences page allows users to enhance their visit to the website by changing the colors of different elements, such as the text and the menu of the website. The usersDb database allows users to post their name as well as their favorite book to allow people to find more new books that others enjoy."

Finally, the delete method is placed to completely delete a user in case they don't want their profile up their anymore. \n",

If the information is missing required parts, like the user age, then it will return a message saying that all fields are required, for example. If you were to change the POST method to a GET method, then there would be an error with finding the user in the database, as it does not exist. "
