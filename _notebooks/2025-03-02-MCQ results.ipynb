    "Overall, I believe that I understood most of the questions. However, there are a couple of main topics that I need to work on. Firstly, I need to learn how bits work, what they are used for, and things related to that. Currently, I was guessing on all of the questions surrounding bits because I just didn't understand how they worked. Second, I need to learn the licenses and other common names on the internet, for example the Creative Commons license. I also need to make sure I know things such as how IP addresses are assigned. I didn't have any knowledge surrounding these topics, so I now know what I need to look up and learn. Finally, the strings and conditionals. There were only two problems asking about these, but I missed both of them. Both questions asked for two answers and, while I was able to get one of them, I somewhow missed the second. To improve, I need to practice more with those types of problems to better be able to gauge exactly what each code block is doing."
